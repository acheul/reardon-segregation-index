* [Github](https://github.com/acheul/reardon-segregation-index)

## Use
  ```python
  ! pip install segindex==0.1.4
  from segindex import estimate_Hp

  # Say, each variables are income.
  # Inner lists of each area stand for sectors.
  # Each area has three sectors in this case.
  # How much is each area segregated by sectors in terms of income?
  area1 = [[80, 80, 70, 70], [50, 45, 40],[20, 20, 20, 10]]
  area2 = [[80, 70, 50], [80, 70, 45, 20, 20], [40, 20, 10]]

  print(estimate_Hp(area1))
  print(estimate_Hp(area2))

  >> 0.7182    
  >> 0.3191
  # area1 is more income-way segregated than area2. In other words, area2 is more mixed.
  ```

## Description

* Many kinds of segregation index are used for various purposes like from policies to studies. While there are a wide range of categorical variables like race group to meausre an amount of segregation, continuous values like income are also important but do not fit very well with categorical segregation index.

* [Reardon(2011)](https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/reardon%20&%20bischoff%20income%20inequality%20segregation%20AJS%20final.pdf), [Reardon and Bischoff(2011)](https://cepa.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/reardon%20&%20bischoff%20income%20inequality%20segregation%20AJS%20final.pdf) propsed a rank-order segregation index based on Theil index which is based on the concept of Entropy. This index is widely accepted for practical and academic uses to calculate continuous value based segregation index like in [Chetty et al. 2014](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19843/w19843.pdf).

* The proposed method of them is a bit intricate however and there seems to be no good online library or code that implements it. Therefore, here is one. Python codes inside [```src/segdex/segregation_index.py```](./src/segdex/segregation_index.py) implements Rank-Order Information Theory Index of Reardon(2011).

* Essentials of the Index

  * The inequality index *H* is an average of each value from a total of K sectors, which is total region's entropy(*E*) minus each sector's entropy(*E_K*). It is weighted by each sector's relative popultaion size(*t_k/T*). Here the entropy stands for how equally variables(ex. income) are distributed over sectors.

  $$ H = \Sigma_{k=1}^{K} \frac{t_{k}}{T} \frac{E-E_{k}}{E} $$

  * Below is an equation to calculate entropy when there is two groups. *p* is a ratio of a group. As the variable here is continuous not categorical, one needs to integrate the below equation over *p* with a range of 0≤p≤1. Thus transformation of raw values into rank ordered values is required.
  
  $$ E(p) = -(p\log_{2}^{p} + (1-p)\log_{2}^{(1-p)}) $$

  * Combining above equations, we can calculate below one to get a Rank-Order Information Theory Index, which is the segregation index for continuous variables. 0 means perfect equality. 1 means perfect segregation.

  $$ H^R = \int_{0}^{1} \frac{E(p)}{\int_{0}^{1} E(q)\,dq} H(p) \,dp \\
      = 2 \log_{2}^{\int_{0}^{1} E(p)H(p) \,dp} $$
